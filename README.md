## Architecture

The architecture of this project is designed to be highly scalable, resilient, and modular. It encompasses the following key components:

### Data Generation

- A Python script (`app_simulation.py`) simulates sales data, generating continuous events representative of an e-commerce website's activities.
- Dependencies for the script are documented in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Data Ingestion and Processing

- **Kinesis Data Streams:** Two Kinesis Data Streams, one for raw data and another for processed data, enable real-time ingestion and processing of sales events. This segmentation allows us to isolate failures, manage workloads independently, and prepare for handling large data volumes in the future.
  
- **Kinesis Data Analytics:** Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics processes and analyzes incoming data streams in real time, including aggregation, transformation, and the generation of key metrics.

### Data Storage and Analysis

- **S3 Bucket:** An Amazon S3 bucket (`SSTO_parquet_data_stream`) stores both raw and processed data, providing durable and scalable storage for historical data.

- **AWS Glue:** AWS Glue is utilized for data transformation, schema creation, and preparation for further analysis.

- **Amazon Athena:** Amazon Athena allows for ad-hoc SQL queries on data stored in the S3 bucket, enabling interactive analysis and insights extraction.

### Monitoring and Visualization

- **Amazon CloudWatch:** Amazon CloudWatch is configured to monitor the performance of data streams, real-time analysis, and other critical services, ensuring early detection of issues and proactive response.

- **Grafana Dashboard:** Grafana is employed to create customized dashboards that visualize key metrics and analysis results, enabling real-time monitoring of the e-commerce website's performance.

### Resilience and Backup

- A **Backup Storage Service** is implemented to safeguard against the failure of any destination service. Data is simultaneously stored in the backup service, ensuring data integrity even in the event of service interruptions.

## Motivation

### Data-Driven Decision-Making

The primary motivation behind this project is to enable businesses to make data-driven decisions in real time. The e-commerce landscape is highly competitive and dynamic, where rapid responses to changing market conditions can make the difference between success and failure.

## Dataset

## Methodology

The methodology adopted for the "ECommerce Sales Analysis and Streaming Monitoring" project follows a well-defined workflow to ensure the efficient and accurate handling of sales data. The methodology can be broken down into the following steps:

### 1. Data Generation

- **Simulation of Sales Data:** The process begins with the simulation of sales data using a Python script (`app_simulation.py`). This script generates continuous events that mimic real sales activities on an e-commerce website. The generated data includes details such as product IDs, purchase timestamps, transaction amounts, and customer information.

- **Data Volume and Velocity:** The script is designed to simulate a realistic volume and velocity of data, reflecting the dynamic nature of e-commerce websites with high traffic and frequent transactions.

### 2. Data Ingestion and Processing

- **Kinesis Data Streams:** Two Kinesis Data Streams are used for data ingestion. The first stream captures raw sales events generated by the Python script. The second stream receives processed data after initial validation and enrichment.

- **Real-Time Data Ingestion:** Kinesis Data Streams enable real-time ingestion of data. The raw data is immediately available for further processing, while the processed data undergoes additional transformations and analysis.

### 3. Real-Time Data Processing

- **Kinesis Data Analytics:** Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics is employed to perform real-time data processing. This includes data transformation, aggregation, and the generation of key performance indicators (KPIs).

- **SQL-Based Transformations:** Kinesis Data Analytics allows for the use of SQL queries to manipulate and transform data as it flows through the system. This enables the calculation of metrics, filtering of relevant events, and data enrichment.

### 4. Data Storage and Analysis

- **S3 Data Storage:** Both raw and processed data are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket (`SSTO_parquet_data_stream`). This provides durable and scalable storage, allowing historical data to be retained for future analysis.

- **AWS Glue:** AWS Glue is utilized for data cataloging, schema creation, and data preparation for analytics. It automatically detects and catalogs the schema of data stored in the S3 bucket, making it queryable using standard SQL.

- **Amazon Athena:** Amazon Athena provides ad-hoc query capabilities for analysts and data scientists. It allows them to run SQL queries directly on the data stored in the S3 bucket, enabling interactive exploration and analysis.

### 5. Monitoring and Visualization

- **Amazon CloudWatch:** Amazon CloudWatch is configured to monitor the performance and health of the entire system. It provides real-time insights into the status of data streams, Kinesis Data Analytics applications, and other critical components.

- **Grafana Dashboard:** Grafana is used to create customized dashboards that visualize key metrics and analysis results. Users can monitor the performance of the e-commerce website and respond to anomalies or trends in real time.

### 6. Resilience and Backup

- **Backup Storage Service:** To ensure data integrity and resilience, a backup storage service is implemented. It duplicates data from the primary storage (S3) to a secondary location, safeguarding against service failures or data corruption.

The methodology outlined above ensures that sales data is collected, processed, and analyzed with a focus on real-time insights and agility. It enables businesses to make data-driven decisions, respond to changing market conditions, and maintain data integrity and availability, even in the face of unexpected events.

This robust methodology is essential for the success of e-commerce businesses, providing them with the tools and processes needed to thrive in a highly competitive and dynamic online marketplace.
